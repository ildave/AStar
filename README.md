# AStar

A html and javascript implementation of the [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).

Heavily inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZj67PTFhc) by [javidx9](http://www.onelonecoder.com). Check [his GitHub](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/) for [his implementation](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/OneLoneCoder_PathFinding_AStar.cpp).

Cells are connected vertically,  horizontally or diagonally with a certain probability, each refresh of the page will provide a different configuration.

Right click sets a cell as an obstacle (black), CTRL + click sets the starting cell (yellow), SHIFT + click sets the end cell (blue). The cells visited by the algorithm are marked in orange.
